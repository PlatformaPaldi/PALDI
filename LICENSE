PALDI is an interactive digital book authoring system that helps the creation of non-linear
stories and other similar activities. Its main goal is to provide a learning environment where 
teachers and students can produce interactive content and have their first contact with programming 
logic. The latter is used to define the behavior of the book's interactive elements. The platform
was developed in a partnership between the universities Federal University of RN (BR), the State 
University of RN (BR), and the University of Aveiro (PT).
